I want to use basePath in React like Nextjs: [Nextjs basePath](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/basepath)
React version: 18.2
basePath:  test

## Steps To Reproduce

1. create react app and add homepage like 
\`\`\`
  .....
  \\"homepage\\": \\"/test\\",
  ....
\`\`\`
2. build and run with the command: \`serve -s build -l 44841 \`
3. access in the browser
